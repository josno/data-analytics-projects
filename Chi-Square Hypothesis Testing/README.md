## Project Summary

I employed the Chi-Square test on categorical variables to evaluate statistically significant correlations through metrics such as alpha level, p-value, and correlation coefficient. Prior to the analysis, I cleaned and prepared the data and generated descriptive statistics.

The thesis paper examines null hypothesis testing and discusses the acceptance or rejection of null hypotheses based on the results. It further acknowledges data limitations and provides actionable recommendations.
