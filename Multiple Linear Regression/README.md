## Project Summary

I evaluated the capacity of multiple linear regression models to predict the length of hospital stay based on patient attributes.

The process included:

- Data Cleaning
- Data Wrangling
  - One-hot Encoding
- Exploratory Analysis
  - Descriptive Statistics
  - Univariate | Bivariate Statistics
- Model Reduction Based On...
  - P-values
  - Multicollinearity (Variance Inflation Factors)
- Model Comparison Using...
  - R-squared
  - AIC/BIC
  - F-statistic Probability

The paper discusses all components of the process, including an extensive discussion of model and data fit based on linear regression assumptions, acknowledgment of data limitations, and recommendations for the next steps.

## Tools Used
