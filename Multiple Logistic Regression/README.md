## Project Summary

I evaluated the capacity of multiple logistic regression models to predict churn based on customer attributes.

The process included:

- Data Cleaning
- Data Wrangling
  - One-hot Encoding
- Exploratory Analysis
  - Descriptive Statistics
  - Univariate | Bivariate Statistics
- Model Reduction Based On...
  - P-values
  - Multicollinearity (Variance Inflation Factors)
- Model Comparison Using...
  - McFadden's pseudo R-squared
  - LLR P-value
  - AIC/BIC
  - Accuracy Score

The paper discusses all components of the process along with extensive discussion on model and data fit based on logistic regression assumptions, acknowledgement of data limitations, and alternative model recommendations.

## Tools Used
