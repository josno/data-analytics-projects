# M.S. in Data Analytics Projects

Hi there, and welcome! This repository is a collection of projects from my journey toward a Master of Science in Data Analytics (MSDA) at Western Governors University (WGU). I'm excited to share how I've used data analysis tools, including SQL, Python, and Tableau, to take on practical business problems.

## About Me

I have a diverse background spanning full-stack web development, education, and media strategy. Through all of my experiences, data has been a consistent thread. From designing and building databases and APIs for efficient data handling in development, to using data for storytelling and simplifying complex ideas in education, to analyzing KPIs and identifying patterns for optimization in media strategy, data has always been central to my work. This program has expanded my data analysis foundations such as introducing me to machine learning.

## Project Summaries

All data analysis projects demonstrate data needs analysis, data preprocessing (i.e. cleaning and transformation), exploratory summary statistics (when necessary), and actionable recommendations.

## Academic Integrity

You are able to access this private repository through a special link from my resume 😁

As a current WGU student, I am bound by the university's academic integrity policy, which prohibits sharing course projects in public repositories with other current students at the school. These projects are not tutorials; they're independent final class assignments designed to demonstrate application of course concepts. Please do not share them outside of your professional consideration.

I appreciate your understanding!
