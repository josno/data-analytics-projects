# M.S. in Data Analytics Projects

Hi there, and welcome! This repository is a collection of projects from my journey toward a Master of Science in Data Analytics (MSDA) at Western Governors University (WGU). I'm excited to share how I've used data analysis tools, including SQL, Python, and Tableau, to take on practical business problems.

## About Me

Hi, my name is Joanne Senoren. I have a diverse background spanning full-stack web development, education, and media strategy. Through all of my experiences, data has been a consistent thread. From designing and building databases and APIs for efficient data handling in development, to using data for storytelling and simplifying complex ideas in education, to analyzing KPIs and identifying patterns for optimization in media strategy, data has always been central to my work. This program has expanded my data analysis foundations such as introducing me to machine learning.

## Project Summaries

These data projects demonstrate the following:
 - Data needs analysis
 - Data preprocessing (i.e. cleaning and transformation)
 - Cloud-based ELT design and engineering
 - Model development
 - Exploratory data
 - Statistical summaries
 - Model evalations
 - Actionable recommendations                                                

## About These Projects

These projects are not tutorials; they're independent final class assignments designed to demonstrate application of course concepts.
